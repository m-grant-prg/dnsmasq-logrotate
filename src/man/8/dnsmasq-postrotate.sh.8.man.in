NAME
dnsmasq-postrotate.sh - postrotate script for dnsmasq
SYNOPSIS
dnsmasq-postrotate.sh [OPTION]
DESCRIPTION
The dnsmasq-postrotate.sh script has two functions; a setup function and a post-rotate function.

Running dnsmasq-postrotate.sh with the --setup option interrogates the dnsmasq configuration and command line to locate the log file and write this location in the logrotate control file. This is run during the package installation and should be run after configuration changes to dnsmasq.

In normal day-to-day operation after logrotate has rotated the log file dnsmasq-postrotate.sh is run with the --post-rotate option whereby SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 are sent to dnsmasq to ask it to dump stats to the log file and to close and reopen it's log file.

During setup the script must determine the log file location and during post-rotate the script must determine the dnsmasq pid file. The two file locations can be specified to dnsmasq with the log-facility and pid-file options. These can be provided via a configuration file or on the command line. Configuration files can be nested via the conf-file and / or conf-dir options. The logic for finding these directives is as follows:-

	a)	Configuration files are processed sequentially and in the
		order they are found.

	b)	The first instance of each directive found is used, in
		fact processing of configuration files terminates
		immediately if both directives are found.

	c)	The first configuration file is either the default,
		sysconfdir/dnsmasq.conf, or if the commmand line contains
		the option -C then the filename specified there is used.

	d)	Any configuration files specified by conf-file, or found
		in a conf-dir directory are appended to the list of
		configuration files to process in the order in which they
		are found.

	e)	If not found in any configuration file then any command
		line specification of these options is used in place of
		the missing directive. (Configuration file value
		overriding command line option is behaviour specified in
		the dnsmasq man page).

	f)	If no pid file is found then as a last resort the pid of
		the running dnsmasq instance is determined and used.
OPTIONS
-h, --help  prints usage information

-p, --post-rotate  invoke the normal post rotate processing for dumping summary
stats and closing and re-opening the log file

-s, --setup  determine the location of the log file and write this to the
logrotate file. (Please refer to the DESCRIPTION section above for the logic of
how it finds this location)

-t, --trace  print information showing how the interrogation of configuration
files and the CL result in the pid and log-facility values to use

-v, --verbose  emits operational status messages

-V, --version  prints version information
EXIT STATUS
0
if OK,

>1
on failure.

64 Invalid arguments
