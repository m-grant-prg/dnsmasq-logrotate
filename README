1 ... Project Description
=========================

This AutoTools project utilises the logrotate facillity to provide log rotation
for dnsmasq.

It places a logrotate control file in sysconfdir/logrotate.d and a post-rotate
script file in sbindir.


-------------------------------------------------
2 ... AutoTools (configure and make) Installation
=================================================

a) ... Download either the source or distribution tarball (the .tar.gz file)
	from:-
	https://github.com/m-grant-prg/dnsmasq-logrotate/releases

b) ... Extract the tarball preserving the directory structure.

c) ... cd to the directory created.

d) ... If you downloaded the source tarball type 'autoreconf -if'

e) ... Type './configure'

f) ... As root or sudo, type 'make install clean'

(Quote marks are for textual clarity only).

To uninstall the package:

1 ... cd to the directory created in the above install process.

2 ... As root or sudo, type 'make uninstall clean'


-------------------------

--------------------------------------
4 ... Debian and Raspbian Installation
======================================
Debian and Raspbian '.deb' packages can be downloaded from:-
	https://github.com/m-grant-prg/dnsmasq-logrotate/releases

They can then be installed using a utility such as GDebi which is available in
the standard repos.


---------------------
5 ... Utility Scripts
=====================
In the project root directory there is 1 helper script; bootstrap.sh.

bootstrap.sh
------------
This misleadingly named script bootstraps the project build and provides other
useful features. The main options below are probably c, D, m and t.

In AutoTools it is usually advisable to perform parallel builds. This means you
build somewhere other than the project root. This is because building creates
files and they would confuse the project root downwards. I always create a build
directory straight off the project root, cd to there and do all build and git
work from there, (.gitignore is already set to ignore such a directory).

Assuming you adopt the preceding paragraph then a typical invocation of the
script would be:-
../bootstrap.sh --make ..
The last '..' points the way to project root.

The full list of arguments to bootstrap.sh are:-
	-c, --distcheck perform a normal make distcheck.

	-d, --debug build with appropriate debug flags.

	-D, --dist perform a make dist.

	-f, --distcheckfake run a make  distcheck  using  a  fake  AT  standard
	directory as a substitute for an absolute path which distcheck does not
	support.

	-g, --gnulib run gnulib-tool --update. Checks for the existence of  the
	cache  file  proj-root/m4/gnulib-cache.m4.  If  it  does  not exist the
	update is not run.

	-h, --help prints usage information.

	-m, --make compile and link - plain make.

	-s, --sparse pass --enable-sparse=yes to configure.

	-t, --source-tarball perform a make srctarball to build a source
	tarball.

	-V, --version prints version information
