1 ... Project Description
=========================

This AutoTools project utilises the logrotate facillity to provide log rotation
for dnsmasq.

It places a logrotate control file in sysconfdir/logrotate.d and a post-rotate
script file in sbindir.

N.B.
----
At a source modification / development level, this project expects to reside in
a git environment. This manifests itself in 2 places:-
1) ... .gitignore files are included in the source.
2) ... The make target, 'srctarball', relies on the command 'git am' so it will
	fail if git is not installed or it is not in a git repository.


-------------------------------------------------
2 ... AutoTools (configure and make) Installation
=================================================

a) ... Download either the source or distribution tarball (the .tar.gz file)
	from:-
	https://github.com/m-grant-prg/dnsmasq-logrotate/releases

b) ... Extract the tarball preserving the directory structure.

c) ... cd to the directory created.

d) ... If you downloaded the source tarball type 'autoreconf -if'

e) ... Type './configure'

f) ... As root or sudo, type 'make install clean'

(Quote marks are for textual clarity only).

To uninstall the package:

1 ... cd to the directory created in the above install process.

2 ... As root or sudo, type 'make uninstall clean'


-------------------------
3 ... Ubuntu Installation
=========================
This script is available as an Ubuntu package hosted in a Personal Package
Archive (PPA). If you add this PPA to your software sources then you can easily
install, update and remove the package.

To view the details of this PPA please follow the link below:-
	https://code.launchpad.net/~m-grant-prg/+archive/ubuntu/utils

To add this PPA to your system please type the following:-
	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:m-grant-prg/utils
	sudo apt-get update

To install this script on your system for use please type the following:-
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install dnsmasq-logrotate

To uninstall this package at any time please type:-
	sudo apt-get remove dnsmasq-logrotate


--------------------------------------
4 ... Debian and Raspbian Installation
======================================
Debian and Raspbian '.deb' packages can be downloaded from:-
	https://github.com/m-grant-prg/dnsmasq-logrotate/releases

They can then be installed using a utility such as GDebi which is available in
the standard repos.


---------------------
5 ... Utility Scripts
=====================
In the project root directory there is 1 helper script; bootstrap.sh.

bootstrap.sh
------------
This misleadingly named script bootstraps the project build and provides other
useful features. The main options below are probably b, c, C, D and T.

In AutoTools it is usually advisable to perform parallel builds. This means you
build somewhere other than the project root. This is because building creates
files and they would confuse the project root downwards. I always create a build
directory straight off the project root, cd to there and do all build and git
work from there, (.gitignore is already set to ignore such a directory).

Assuming you adopt the preceding paragraph then a typical invocation of the
script would be:-
../bootstrap.sh --build ..
The last '..' points the way to project root.

The full list of arguments to bootstrap.sh are:-
	-b, --build make the project.

	-c, --config configure the project.

	-C, --distcheck perform a normal make distcheck.

	-d, --debug build with appropriate debug flags.

	-D, --dist perform a make dist.

	-F, --distcheckfake run a make distcheck using a fake AT standard
	directory as a substitute for an absolute path which distcheck does not
	support.

	-g, --gnulib run gnulib-tool --update. Checks for the existence of the
	cache file proj-root/m4/gnulib-cache.m4. If it does not exist the update
	is not run.

	-h, --help prints usage information.

	-s, --sparse pass --enable-sparse=yes to configure.

	-T, --source-tarball perform a make srctarball to build a source
	tarball.

	-V, --version prints version information

Options b build, C distcheck, D dist, F distcheckfake and T source-tarball are
mutually exclusive.

Options d debug, F distcheckfake and s sparse are enabled by configure so
require option c config.
